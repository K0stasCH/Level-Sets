        "\n",
        "The Siren MLP, published in the paper **Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions** is a novel architecture that explores the usage of sinusoidal activations in fitting problems. By overfitting the model on a single sample, the Siren model can accurately reconstruct the sample and its gradients. \n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook we will be training the Siren MLP on an oriented point cloud, and reconstructing its Signed Distance Function (SDF). The SDF is a function $ f(\\mathbf{x} ; \\mathcal{m}) : \\mathbb{R}^3 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$, i.e it maps an arbitrary point $\\mathbf{x}$ of 3d space to its distance from the 3d object $\\mathcal{m}$. If the point lies on the surface of $\\mathcal{m}$, then the distance is 0, whereas if the point lies outside or inside the object, then the distance is positive/negative respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to visualize and evaluate the resulting SDF we will use an isosurfacing operation called \"Marching Cubes\". This script will generate a mesh from the SDF, which we can then visualize as we normally would.\n",

        "**Usage Instructions**\n",
        "\n",
        "Download the .zip file from eclass and upload it on google colab. You can do that in 2 ways by following the instructions below. Extract the contents and then install all the relevant libraries (you can do so by running the cells provided below). In the \"data\" folder you will upload the sample you want to fit and reconstruct. The sample must be an **oriented point cloud** in \".xyz\" format (that is, points along with their respective normal vectors). You can convert a mesh into an oriented point cloud using the open source tool [Meshlab](https://www.meshlab.net/).\n",
        "\n",
        "The code cells tend to get quite large, so for the sake of simplicity we use these code cells to call scripts from .py files. You are welcome to look into the code if interested. \n",

The reader is encouraged to visit their repository and play around with the various visual tools they have created."
